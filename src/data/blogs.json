But it was in his second year that he started venturing into the world of internships. His first stepping stone was at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) where he got to work on computer vision, a nascent field at the time. This opportunity allowed him to take his first step into the realm of practical applications of computer science. His journey didn't stop there, however. The following year, Prateek interned at Adobe Research, a name that needs no introduction. Here, he got to dive headfirst into cutting-edge research and even secured a patent, a testament to his skill and dedication."

When the time came to apply for internships, he made sure to equip himself with knowledge of computer vision through a course, which he then utilized during his work interestingly , Prateek landed his DRDO internship through a series of cold emails to professors at foreign universities, IITs, and various other places. Among the few acceptances he received was an opportunity to connect with a scientist at DRDO through a professor at IIT Dharwad. This goes to show that sometimes, opportunities come from the most unexpected places."

Prateek suggests receiving feedback from industry professionals and incorporating that into your resume for maximum effect. Prateek offers valuable advice for those who perform well in coding rounds but get stuck in interviews. His approach towards preparation involves understanding the types of questions that a company typically asks in its interviews. He found it useful to explore platforms like LeetCode to better prepare for his coding interviews at companies like CRED.

I feel like you can start preparing for CAT during the summer vacation for the 3rd or 4th year. For example, if the exam is in November, you should ideally have started at least in March. This will give you ample time to prepare for the exam. Speaking about the amount of preparation, I don’t feel like you have to go to a specific coaching. The key is to practice and solve mock question papers. Identify your strengths and weaknesses, and commit at least some hours to solving a test series online each week. "

Apart from this, I think it might be a good idea to practice your English skills by reading books, but I did not do this. People tend to read books in two distinct ways - skimming through without much thought or thoroughly understanding and reading between the lines. To enhance your skills, you should strive for the latter approach. Comprehending the underlying meaning will prove more beneficial than mere reading. There's a common misconception that extraordinary verbal skills are required to score well in this section. However, I believe consistent practice can help achieve good scores"

              "text": "I’ll give an example of a strategy that you could follow. In CAT, the paper is of 198 marks. If you score 50%, which is around 99 marks, you would cross 99.7 percentile. This means that you would get a call from all the IIMs. So you have to just score around 50% of the marks. This is why you must figure out what your strengths and weaknesses are in the first two months of preparation, as I mentioned before. So let’s take the example of the quant section- there are 22 questions. If you attempt 16 questions and you can be sure that 14 or 15 of them are definitely correct, you’re good. For example, there were certain areas that I had issues with, and I would keep them for later while solving all the questions from areas that I’m strong in. This maximizes your marks. The test is time-bound, so it is a bad idea to spend too much time on a question that you don’t understand. Spend more time on your strengths, and try not to attempt questions that you are not too confident about. This is how a general CAT strategy would work. "

Moreover, a lot of foreign universities require work experience, so it wasn’t suitable for me. I chose IIM-A for its reputation and the flexibility it offers. They provide you a chance to defer your admission if your work experience is under 2 years, provided that you have a job offer in hand before a stipulated date. I wanted to experience the industry and explore a bit apart from academics, and therefore I deferred my admission by a year. Moreover, I won't deny that I desired a short break before embarking on another academic journey. After years dedicated to JEE and IIT preparation, I felt a brief hiatus was justified."

Utilize your initial years to explore and identify your genuine interests. Determine which topics capture your curiosity and which do not. This approach leaves ample time during your final two years, especially the fourth year with its lighter academic load, to develop these interests. From an MBA or higher studies perspective, I’d say not to listen blindly to anyone who says a field is good. It is better if you explore yourself and find a field that you love and is viable at the same time. I wish you a successful and fulfilling journey in life!"

Avoid future regrets by taking this opportunity to grow and learn. You won't have to rely on seniors for guidance if you focus on personal development now. Embrace whatever comes your way and enjoy the best experiences that life offers. Embrace student life to the fullest."

To prepare for the speaking section, I watched some YouTube videos, which provided prompts and helped me practice timing my responses. If you're looking to expand your vocabulary, I recommend an app GRE Edge. This app offers over 1600 words for free, and it's a valuable resource for improving your vocabulary, which can be beneficial for both GRE and TOEFL scores.

The main components include your CV or resume, GRE scores (though some universities don't require them anymore), your Statement of Purpose (SOP), and Letters of Recommendation (LoRs). Some institutions may have additional requirements like a personal statement or diversity statement. Starting the process early is crucial. GRE scores are valid for five years, and TOEFL scores are valid for two years. Taking these tests as soon as possible is advisable. Then, focus on your LoRs. It's essential to approach professors or professionals who can write strong, detailed letters that go beyond generic praise. Specific anecdotes highlighting your skills, accomplishments, and growth can make a significant difference. Your CV or resume should showcase relevant experiences, such as research internships and elective courses related to your field of interest. While co-curricular activities are important, they shouldn't overshadow academic achievements. GPA is still a crucial factor in the application process, although some debate exists about its weight. While it's possible to get into a good university without a high GPA, a strong academic record simplifies the process. In summary, start the application process early, prioritize LoRs from individuals who can provide specific examples of your skills, and create a well-rounded resume that emphasizes research experiences and relevant electives. Craft a well-structured SOP tailored to each university's requirements and expectations. With careful planning and attention to detail, you can create a compelling application for the graduate programs of your choice."

In the first year, you might be involved in activities like (NSO) but afterward, it's up to you to maintain your physical and mental health. Explore opportunities to join clubs and take on leadership roles. If you have a strong interest in a particular topic, remember that there are countless resources available today.

The Start & Journey Through IIT Dharwad by himself ... \"I spent my first year figuring out my way around college until the pandemic started and I had to go home. I started exploring new languages and technologies at home. We did a few college projects like the election website during our third semester which further strengthened my interest in coding. I believe this led to me getting a couple of off-campus internships in some early-stage startups. I got to work on some really cool stuff there! I continued to build on this experience through some more internships and projects, which eventually landed my current role at CRED. I was initially more interested in the electronics side of things and participated in the Inter IIT Robotics competition in my first year. We built a terrace farming robot. When I went home, I found myself wondering what more could be done and what more could be automated. This led to me building a simple web application and layering it over the robotics part of our project. I started exploring more and eventually learned new things. I was not really interested in competitive coding, but I did some just before the placement season in my 4th year.\""
